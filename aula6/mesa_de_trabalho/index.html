                <p><span>Brasileiro em destaque na area de tecnologia</span></p>
                <p>I am the co-founder of Codeminer 42 a successful Ruby on Rails boutique in Brazil, serving advanced
                    clients in Brazil and the USA. We have almost zero overhead and the head count of 100+ is almost all
                    developers, self-organized in each project and also self-managing 12 physical offices around the
                    country.
                </p>
                <p>I am the creator and organizer of Rubyconf Brazil, which I organize with Locaweb every year since
                    2008.
                    It's always growing and in 2015 we had our largest ever with more then 1,200 attendees talking about
                    Ruby and new technology such as Elixir, Go. I retired from Rubyconf Brazil in 2016.
                </p>
                <p>I have been programming and evangelizing Ruby since 2006. But I have been a professional programmer
                    since
                    1997. I went through many kinds of industries, from publicity agencies to SAP consultancies, to
                    startups
                    prior to the legendary bubble crash of 2001. I have seen it all.</p>
                <p>
                    By the way, I do not like people that focus only on head hunting. Do not try to add me here. I am
                    not
                    accepting job offers. I can offer my company (CodeMiner 42) for software development outsourcing
                    services.
